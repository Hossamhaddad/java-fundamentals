## 2. Contains Duplicates Method : a method takes an array and return true if the array have duplicate values, or return false if there's no duplicate values.

## 3. Calculating Averages method :a method that takes an array of integers (numbers) and calculate the averege of the numbers and return the result .

## 4. lowest average Method : a method that takes a matrix (array of arrays ) and calculate the avarege for each array and return the array of the lowest averege .
